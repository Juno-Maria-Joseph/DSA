# 🐍 DSA Practice in Python

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
This repo contains Python implementations of important DSA concepts that I’ve practiced to strengthen my problem-solving and coding skills.

   - Analyzing algorithm efficiency

3. **Recursion**  
   - Basic recursion problems  
   - Recursive vs iterative approaches

4. **Arrays**  
   - Searching, insertion, deletion  
   - Techniques: sliding window, two pointers, etc.

5. **Linked Lists**  
   - Singly and doubly linked lists  
   - Operations: insert, delete, reverse

6. **Sorting Algorithms**  
   - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort  
   - Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort

7. **Stack and Queue**  
   - Using lists and `collections.deque`  
   - Applications like balanced parentheses, queue reversal

8. **Trees**  
   - Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees  
   - Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder  
   - Depth and height calculations

9. **Dynamic Programming**
